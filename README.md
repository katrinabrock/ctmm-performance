# CTMM Performance Improvement Project

These are some scripts I used in an attempt to profile, and improve runtime of Chris Flemming's [ctmm package](https://github.com/ctmm-initiative/ctmm). These scripts are not intended for re-use, but might be a helpful reference for similar projects. (Improving performance of an existing R statistical package.)

This work was conducted at and therefore funded by the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior.
